# sikuli

This simple sikuli module (python based) was wrote to allow "typing" on Sikuli.
There are some situations we need to type a text eg. (type-and-search fields)
So instead of using type() (which returns a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException ( java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Key: Not supported character), you shold use type_alt() function.
